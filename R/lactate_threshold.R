#' Lactate threshold
#'
#' This is a general function that applies several lactate threshold methods at the same time.
#'
#' @param .data The raw data.
#' @param intensity_column The name of the intensity column.
#' @param lactate_column The name of the lactate column.
#' @param heart_rate_column The name of the heart rate column, if applicable.
#' @param method The lactate threshold method to calculate. It can be one or many of the following:
#' `Log-log`, `OBLA`, `Bsln+`, `Dmax`, `LTP`, `LTratio`, `IAT`. See `Details` for more information.
#' Default to `c("Log-log", "OBLA", "Bsln+", "Dmax", "LTP", "LTratio", "IAT")`.
#' @param fit The fit you would like to use for finding the lactate values associated to each one of the lactate thresholds.
#' Please, note that a few lactate thresholds have default methods for this and cannot be changed.
#' Options are `3rd degree polynomial`, `4th degree polynomial`, or `B-spline`. See `Details`.
#' @param include_baseline A boolean to indicate whether to include the baseline value in the fit.
#' @param sport The sport at which the incremental test was performed. One of `cycling`, `running`, or `swimming`.
#' @param loglog_restrainer A scalar from 0 to 1 indicating the percentage of the data that you would like to
#' restrain for fitting the Log-Log method. For example, `1` means no restriction (fits using the whole data), and `0.5` means that
#' only the first 50% of the data will be used. Default to `1`.
#' @param plot A boolean to indicate whether to generate a plot from each one of the methods. Default to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return a tibble with the following columns:
#' \item{method_category}{the category of the lactate threshold method.}
#' \item{method}{the method used to estimate the lactate threshold}
#' \item{fitting}{the fitting method used to predict the lactate curve}
#' \item{intensity}{the intensity associated with the estimated lactate threshold}
#' \item{lactate}{the lactate concentration associated with the estimated lactate threshold}
#' \item{heart_rate}{the heart rate associated with the estimated lactate threshold}
#' \item{plot}{the plot produced to display the lactate threshold}
#'
#' @details
#'
#' ## Log-log
#'
#' The lactate response (i.e., log of lactate vs intensity) is divided into two segments.
#' A segmented regression is then performed such that the lactate curve would present one breaking point. The exercise
#' intensity at which the breaking point occurs is then considered as Log-log (Beaver et al., 1985).
#' Caution: this method might require a double-check via a visual inspection, depending in some cases.
#'
#' ## OBLA
#'
#' The Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation (OBLA) is the exercise intensity at fixed lactate of 2.0, 2.5,
#' 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mmol/L (Heck et al., 1985, Kindermann et al., 1979; Skinner & Mclellan, 1980). The lactate curve is usually fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
#' but the user can define another method (4th degree polynomial or B-spline).
#'
#' ## Bsln+
#'
#' In the baseline plus method (Bsln+), the exercise intensity at which lactate increases to 0.5, 1.0,
#' and 1.5 mmol/L above baseline (resting) values is considered (Berg et al., 1990; Zoladz et al., 1995). The lactate curve is usually fitted using a
#' 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
#' but the user can define another method (4th degree polynomial or B-spline).
#'
#' ## Dmax
#'
#' ### Dmax
#'
#' The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
#' between the first and the last data point (Cheng et al., 1992). The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
#' and it can't be changed.
#'
#' ### Modified Dmax (ModDmax)
#'
#' The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
#' between data point preceding the first rise in lactate greater than 0.4 mmol/L and the last
#' data point (Bishop et al., 1998). The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
#' and it can't be changed.
#'
#' ### Exponential Dmax (Exp-Dmax)
#'
#' The exercise intensity on the exponential plus-constant regression lactate curve that
#' yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line between the first and the
#' last data point (Hughson et al., 1987). The lactate curve is fitted using an exponential curve,
#' and it can't be changed.
#'
#' ### Log-log modified Dmax (Log-Poly-ModDmax)
#'
#' The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
#' between Log-log and the last data point in the 3rd order polynomial regression curve (Jamnick et al., 2018).
#' The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
#' and it can't be changed.
#'
#' ### Log-log exponential Dmax (Log-Exp-ModDmax)
#'
#' The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
#' between Log-log and the last data point in the exponential curve (Jamnick et al., 2018).
#' The lactate curve is fitted using an exponential curve,
#' and it can't be changed.
#'
#' ## LTP
#'
#' ### Lactate Turning Point 1 (LTP1) and Lactate Turning Point 2 (LTP2)
#'
#' the lactate response is divided into three segments. A segmented regression is performed
#' such that the lactate curve yields two breaking points. The first breaking point, representing
#' the first rise in lactate above resting levels, is considered as LTP1. The second breaking point,
#' representing an accelerated lactate accumulation, is then considered as LTP2
#' (Hofmann & Tschakert, 2017; Hofmann et al., 1997; Pokan et al., 1997).
#' Caution: this method might require a double-check via a visual inspection, depending in some cases.
#'
#' ## LTratio
#'
#' The lactate response (i.e., ratio of lactate / exercise intensity vs exercise intensity) is interpolated
#' using a B-spline regression curve. LTratio is then defined as the lowest value of the lactate / exercise intensity
#' ratio, which attempts to describe the onset of the lactate increase (Dickhuth et al., 1999).
